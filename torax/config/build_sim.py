"""Functions to build sim.Sim objects, which are used to run TORAX."""

from torax.torax_pydantic import model_config as pydantic_model_config


def build_sim_from_config(
    config: Mapping[str, Any],
) -> sim_lib.Sim:
  """Builds a sim.Sim object from the given TORAX config.

  A TORAX config is a nested Python dictionary mapping to arguments of the Sim
  object, which is an intermediate data structure used to execute a TORAX
  simulation run.

  The dictionary has an expected set of keys and structure to it. If the input
  configuration does not match the expected structure, then an error is raised.

  See https://torax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html for
  documentation on all input variables.

  High-level, the input config has the following keys:

  .. code-block:: python

    {
        runtime_params: {...},
        geometry: {...},
        sources: {...},
        transport: {...},
        stepper: {...},
        time_step_calculator: {...},
    }

  To learn more about the Sim object and its components, see `sim.Sim`'s class
  docstring.

  Args:
    config: Input config dictionary outlining the necessary components of the
      `Sim` object. The input config requires these keys: `runtime_params`,
      `geometry`, `sources`, `transport`, `stepper`, and `time_step_calculator`.

  Returns:
    `Sim` object ready to be run.
  Raises:
    ValueError if any config parameters are missing or incorrect.
